# Portfolio v2 — The macOS Portfolio

A highly immersive, physics-driven web portfolio built to meticulously replicate the modern macOS architecture (Sonoma/Sequoia). Engineered from the ground up using React, GSAP 3, and Tailwind CSS v4 to deliver a pixel-perfect liquid glass experience directly in the browser.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Window Management:** Fully functional Draggable windows constrained by viewport bounds. Features authentic GSAP-driven **Genie-effect** minimize animations, double-click to maximize, and intelligent z-index drop-shadow stacking based on active window focus.
- **System-Wide Dark Mode:** Deep integration with Tailwind v4's custom class variants, allowing the entire OS—from the Control Center to individual folders—to seamlessly toggle between Light and Dark mode using liquid glass `backdrop-blur` UI panels.
- **Interactive Top Bar & Control Center:** A live macOS top bar that detects active apps, alongside a functional Control Center featuring draggable brightness sliders and system toggles.
- **Fully Ported Apps:** 
  - **Terminal:** A functional CLI environment loaded with custom commands (`help`, `about`, `projects`, `matrix`) and native **Groq AI Chat integration**.
  - **Safari:** A functional `iframe`-based web browser with tab management and an active URL search bar.
  - **Finder:** Features a sidebar directory tree and a grid-based folder viewer targeting the `trash`, `work`, and `resume` files.
- **Desktop Layer Effects:** The system runs a live weather widget powered by the Open-Meteo API, a ticking real-time clock, and handles Spotlight Search overlay filtering dynamically.
